# Description.

The general aim of the following study was to find the genetic potential of black poplar's resistance (*Populus nigra*) when they are infected by rust.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
library(jpeg)
library(knitr)

include_graphics(c("rust_infection_2.jpg", "Screenshot_2.png", "rust_infection_1.jpg"))
``` 
  
Here are the illustrations when black poplar leaves are infected by rust. The picture on the left is an overall infection, and the picture on the right is a zoomed visualization.  
  
Before proceeding to a more sophisticated modeling, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gather insights from the dataset.  

---

**About the raw dataset and the species used**  

The raw data consists of the measurement in the lab for poplar resistance.   
  
The variables needed in the analysis were:  
- **Latent period, coded as Laten**    
- **Number of spores, coded as NbSS**  
_ **Size of spores, coded as Taiil**  
  
These are the indication of infection on poplar leaves.  
  
The spesies is black poplar (*Populus nigra*) that was collected from several natural populations and sources in Western Europe.

**Experimental design**

The experimental design was as follow: 168 individuals (including the discriminants) spread across 5 blocks were inoculated with 3 rust strains. These make up a total 2520 observations of 15 variables.  
  
Note. not all variables are going to be used, we will see as we proceed through this script.  
  
The objectives of this first step of prelim analysis were:  

## Objectives.
1. Check the resistant vs susceptible individuals.  
2. Understand the global distribution of each phenotype.  
3. Understand the variability in distribution of the phenotypes for each strain.  
  
# Preparation (libraries, working directory, data set).
```{r preparation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(plyr)  # to create a frequency table of resistant vs susceptible individuals
library(naniar)  # to replace values with NA
library(ggplot2)  # to make graphs
library(ggpubr)  # to arrange ggplot graphs in columns and rows

# Loading the raw data set ----
rust_test1 <- read.delim2("B4est_test1_LectureJ13_J14_commented.txt", na = "NA")

head(rust_test1)

# Selection of columns ----
test1_selec <- rust_test1[ ,-c(12, 13, 15)]  # getting only the columns that we need

head(test1_selec)
```

# Checking the resistant vs susceptible individuals.

This step will result in two groups of individuals; resistant and susceptible individuals.  
  
*Resistant individuals are the individuals that are not interacting with the rust, thus do not have symptoms.*  
  
*Susceptible individuals are the individuals that are interacting with the rust, thus causing symptoms.*  
  
The checking was carried out after excluding the control individuals.

Note resistant and susceptible are referring to poplar's responses. The rust id on the top shows the type of pathogen that infected the poplar. This graph shows the share of resistant and susceptible poplars when they were infected with different pathogen types. The poplars were behaving quite similarly. There were around 700 susceptible poplars. These are the poplars that I studied to see whether they were behaving differently or not. Also, whether they had the chance to fight the pathogen.

Strictly speaking, it is rather tricky to say that these 700 poplars were susceptible. It is more effective to say that these 700 poplars were actively interacting with the pathogen, while the rest were not really interacting with the pathogen. When the poplars are interactive, it means that they can behave differently or they can fight the pathogen with different abilities. Let's stick with this definition now.

## Counting the completely resistant individuals (meaning that they are not interacting with the pathogen)
```{r incomp all strains}
# Calculating the numbers of resistant individuals for pathogen 09AX27

incomp_09AX27 <- plyr::count(test1_09AX27_nodisc$Genotype[
  which(test1_09AX27_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp == -5)])

# Calculating the numbers of resistant individuals for pathogen 93JE3

incomp_93JE3 <- plyr::count(test1_93JE3_nodisc$Genotype[
  which(test1_93JE3_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp == -5)])

# Calculating the numbers of resistant individuals for pathogen P72

incomp_P72 <- plyr::count(test1_P72_nodisc$Genotype[
  which(test1_P72_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp == -5)])

# Finding the individuals that are resistant across the pathogens

common_resist = data.frame(intersect(incomp_09AX27$x, incomp_93JE3$x))

common_final = data.frame(intersect(common_resist$intersect.incomp_09AX27.x..incomp_93JE3.x.,
                                    incomp_P72$x))

names(common_final)[1] = "resistant across the pathogens"

common_final

```

Turned out three poplar individuals were completely resistant across all the pathogens. It means that they were completely not interacting with the pathogens. Pathogens' activities were indifferent to them.

# The global distribution of the raw data
In this step, we will see the global distribution of trait variation.    
  
We also need to:  
1. Replace the value -5 to NA. Replace 0 to NA as well for Uredinia Size.    
2. Total number of uredinia by adding the sporulating uredinia (NbSS) and sporulating uredinia underwater (NbSO).  
3. Total number of black points by substracting the observed black points (NbPtN) by the black points found before first appearance of sporulating uredinia (points.noirs.avant.le.test).  
4. Removing discriminant and control individuals.  

```{r global dist prep}
test1_selec_NA <- test1_selec  # creating a new data frame to avoid confusion
test1_selec_NA <-  test1_selec_NA %>% 
  naniar::replace_with_na(replace = list(Laten_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         NbSS_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         NbSO_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         NbPtN_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         Taill_05.08.20_gp = c(-5,0)))

## Total uredinia number = adding NbSS and NbSoS
test1_selec_NA$total_NbSS <- test1_selec_NA$NbSS_24.02.15_gp + 
  test1_selec_NA$NbSO_24.02.15_gp

## Total black points = substracting NbPtN by point noires avant le test
test1_selec_NA$PtN_real <- test1_selec_NA$NbPtN_24.02.15_gp - 
  test1_selec_NA$points.noirs.avant.le.test

# Replacing negative values in PtN_real to 0
test1_selec_NA$PtN_real <- replace(test1_selec_NA$PtN_real, 
                                   test1_selec_NA$PtN_real < 0, 0)

## Removing the discriminants and the control
test1_selec_NA[ ,15] <- "NA"
for (i in c(1:nrow(test1_selec_NA))){

    test1_selec_NA[i,15] <- "control"
}

test1_NA_nodisc <- test1_selec_NA[-which(test1_selec_NA[ ,15] %in%
                                           c("control", "discrim")), ]
