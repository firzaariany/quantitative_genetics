# Description.

The general aim of the study was to find the genetic potential of black
poplar's resistance (*Populus nigra*) when they are infected by rust
fungi.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
library(jpeg)
library(knitr)

include_graphics(c("rust_infection_2.jpg", "Screenshot_2.png", "rust_infection_1.jpg"))
```

Here are the illustrations when black poplar leaves are infected by
rust. The picture on the left is an overall infection, and the picture
on the right is a zoomed visualization.

Before proceeding to a more sophisticated modeling, I conducted an
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gather the initial insights from the
dataset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**About the raw dataset and the species used**

The raw data consists of the measurement in the lab for poplar
resistance.

The variables needed in the analysis were:\
- **Latent period, coded as Laten**\
- **Number of spores, coded as NbSS**\
\_ **Size of spores, coded as Taiil**

Together, they are called "resistance components".

The spesies is black poplar (*Populus nigra*) that was collected from
several natural populations and sources in Western Europe.

**Experimental design**

The experimental design was as follow: 154 poplar individuals spread
across 5 blocks were infected with 3 rust types. These make up a total
2520 observations of 15 variables.

Note. not all variables are going to be used, we will see as we proceed
through this script.

The objectives of this first step of prelim analysis were:

## Objectives.

1.  Check the resistant vs susceptible individuals.\
2.  Understand the global distribution of the resistance components.\
3.  Understand the variability in the resistance components between the
    rust types.

# Preparation (libraries, working directory, data set).

```{r preparation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(plyr)  # Create a frequency table of resistant vs susceptible individuals
library(naniar)  # Replace values with NA
library(ggplot2)  # Make graphs
library(ggpubr)  # Arrange ggplot graphs in columns and rows

# Loading the raw data set ----
rust_test1 = read.delim2("B4est_test1_LectureJ13_J14_commented.txt", na = "NA")

# Selection of columns ----
test1_selec = rust_test1[ ,-c(12, 13, 15)]  # getting only the columns that we need
```

In the raw dataset I had 15 variables. I did not need all these 15
variables, so for simplicity, I selected only the variables that I
needed. The preview of the first 5 observation in the dataset with the
variables I needed is shown below:

```{r dataset of the selected variables}
head(test1_selec)
```

# Checking the resistant vs susceptible individuals.

This step will result in two groups of individuals; resistant and
susceptible individuals.

*Resistant individuals are the individuals that are not interacting with
the pathogen, thus do not have symptoms.*

*Susceptible individuals are the individuals that are interacting with
the pathogen, thus causing symptoms.*

Note resistant and susceptible are referring to poplar's responses. The
pathogen type on the top of each figure shows the type of pathogen that
infected the poplars. This graph shows the share of resistant and
susceptible poplars when they were infected with different pathogen
types. The poplars were behaving quite similarly. There were around 700
susceptible poplars. The susceptible ones are the poplars that I would
study to see whether they were behaving differently from each other.
Also, whether they had the chance to fight the pathogen.

Strictly speaking, it is rather tricky to say that these 700 poplars
were susceptible. It is more effective to say that these 700 poplars
were actively interacting with the pathogen, while the rest were not
really interacting with the pathogen. When the poplars are interactive,
it means that they can behave differently or they can fight the pathogen
with different abilities. Let's stick with this definition now.

## Counting the completely resistant individuals (meaning that they are not interacting with the pathogen)

```{r incomp all strains}
# Calculating the numbers of resistant individuals for pathogen 09AX27

incomp_09AX27 = plyr::count(test1_09AX27_nodisc$Genotype[
  which(test1_09AX27_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp == -5)])

# Calculating the numbers of resistant individuals for pathogen 93JE3

incomp_93JE3 = plyr::count(test1_93JE3_nodisc$Genotype[
  which(test1_93JE3_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp == -5)])

# Calculating the numbers of resistant individuals for pathogen P72

incomp_P72 = plyr::count(test1_P72_nodisc$Genotype[
  which(test1_P72_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp == -5)])

# Finding the individuals that are resistant across the pathogens

common_resist = data.frame(intersect(incomp_09AX27$x, incomp_93JE3$x))

common_final = data.frame(intersect(common_resist$intersect.incomp_09AX27.x..incomp_93JE3.x., incomp_P72$x))

names(common_final)[1] = "resistant across the pathogens"

common_final
```

Turned out three poplar individuals were completely resistant across all
the pathogens. It means that they were completely not interacting with
the pathogens. Pathogens' activities were indifferent to them.

# Graphical distribution of the resistance components

After inspecting which individuals that were resistant and which were
susceptible, I wanted to look into my data as a whole. So, before
continuing to data cleaning and EDA, I wanted to see the overall
distribution of my dataset.

```{r global dist prep}
# Some preparation

test1_selec_NA = test1_selec  # creating a new data frame to avoid confusion

# Replacing -5 to NA because -5 was the code for missing data during
# the experiment

test1_selec_NA =  test1_selec_NA %>% 
  naniar::replace_with_na(replace = list(Laten_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         NbSS_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         NbSO_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         NbPtN_24.02.15_gp = -5,
                                         Taill_05.08.20_gp = c(-5,0)))

## Total uredinia number = adding NbSS and NbSoS

test1_selec_NA$total_NbSS = test1_selec_NA$NbSS_24.02.15_gp + 
  test1_selec_NA$NbSO_24.02.15_gp

## Total black points = substracting NbPtN by point noires avant le test

test1_selec_NA$PtN_real = test1_selec_NA$NbPtN_24.02.15_gp - 
  test1_selec_NA$points.noirs.avant.le.test

# Replacing negative values in PtN_real to 0

test1_selec_NA$PtN_real = replace(test1_selec_NA$PtN_real, 
                                   test1_selec_NA$PtN_real < 0, 0)

## Removing the discriminants and the control

test1_selec_NA[ ,15] = "NA"

for (i in c(1:nrow(test1_selec_NA))){
  
  if(test1_selec_NA$Genotype[i] %in% discrim$Discrim)
    test1_selec_NA[i,15] = "discrim"
  
  if(test1_selec_NA$Genotype[i] == "Robusta")
    test1_selec_NA[i,15] = "control"
}

test1_NA_nodisc = test1_selec_NA[-which(test1_selec_NA[ ,15] %in%
                                           c("control", "discrim")), ]

## Histogram of each trait

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

test1_loop = data.frame("LP" = test1_NA_nodisc$Laten_24.02.15_gp,
                         "UN" = test1_NA_nodisc$total_NbSS,
                         "US" = test1_NA_nodisc$Taill_05.08.20_gp)

names(test1_loop)[1:3] = c("Latent Period", "Uredinia Number", "Uredinia Size")

loop.vector = 1:3

for (i in loop.vector){
  x = test1_loop[,i]
  title = names(test1_loop[i])
  hist(x,
       main = title,
       xlab = "Scores")
}
```

**Latent period.** By definition, it is the time needed for the
individuals to start showing the first symptoms of infection. When
poplars were infected with rust, the symptom would be yellow spores that
are populating poplar's leaves. In my study, most poplars started having
this symptom on the 9th, 10th, and 11th day after inoculation (i.e.
exposure to the pathogen).

**Uredinia number**. By definition, it is the number of spores that are
populating the poplar's leaves. On the day 14 after inoculation, I
counted the uredinia number. Most poplars had 1 - 40 spores on their
leaves by this day.

**Uredinia size**. By definition, it is the size of the spores that are
populating the poplar's leaves. On the day 14, I evaluated the uredinia
size by scoring it. The score goes from 1 (the smallest) to 5 (the
largest). In my study, most poplars had spores with sizes scored 3 - 4.

Note that in this part I just summarized the distribution of the
resistance components from my dataset as a whole.

Remember that I had 5 blocks which served as repetitions to avoid bias.
In this section, I acknowledged the individuals in 5 blocks as different
individuals. The idea was to see how they were behaving in general and
what distribution I could expect from my data. However, after I clean
the data, I would get one value averaged across 5 blocks for an
individual's resistance components.

# Graphical distribution of the resistance components depending on the pathogen types

Now I want to crosscheck the previous distribution (that was not
considering the different pathogens I used) with the following
distribution where I sparse the distribution based on the pathogens.
Will the resistance components have the same distribution as before?

```{r data prep}
## Subsetting the clean dataset based on pathogen

s09AX27_clean = test1_NA_nodisc[which(test1_NA_nodisc$Strain == "09AX27"),]
s93JE3_clean = test1_NA_nodisc[which(test1_NA_nodisc$Strain == "93JE3"),]
sP72_clean = test1_NA_nodisc[which(test1_NA_nodisc$Strain == "P72"),]
```

## Graphical inspection pathogen 09AX27

```{r trait dist 09AX27}
s09AX27_loop = data.frame("LP" = s09AX27_clean$Laten_24.02.15_gp,
                           "UN" = s09AX27_clean$total_NbSS,
                           "US" = s09AX27_clean$Taill_05.08.20_gp)
loop.vector = 1:3

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

for (i in loop.vector){
  x = s09AX27_loop[,i]
  title = names(s09AX27_loop[i])
  hist(x,
       main = paste("09AX27", title),
       xlab = "Scores")
}
```

## Graphical inspection pathogen 93JE3

```{r trait dist 93JE3}
s93JE3_loop = data.frame("LP" = s93JE3_clean$Laten_24.02.15_gp,
                          "UN" = s93JE3_clean$total_NbSS,
                          "US" = s93JE3_clean$Taill_05.08.20_gp)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

for (i in loop.vector){
  x = s93JE3_loop[,i]
  title = names(s93JE3_loop[i])
  hist(x,
       main = paste("93JE3", title),
       xlab = "Scores")
}
```

## Graphical inspection pathogen P72

```{r trait dist P72}
sP72_loop = data.frame("LP" = sP72_clean$Laten_24.02.15_gp,
                        "UN" = sP72_clean$total_NbSS,
                        "US" = sP72_clean$Taill_05.08.20_gp)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

for (i in loop.vector){
  x = sP72_loop[,i]
  title = names(sP72_loop[i])
  hist(x,
       main = paste("P72", title),
       xlab = "Scores")
}
```

When I sparse the distribution of each variable based on the pathogens,
the variables still follow the similar pattern as the previous one
(without sparsing based on the pathogens). So probably it is a normal
pattern in the interaction between poplars and rust fungus.

If I have to point at the differences in poplar's resistance across
pathogen types...

**Latent period**. Poplars that were infected by 93JE3 and P72 started
showing symptoms in much earlier days than the poplars infected by
09AX27

**Uredinia number**. Poplars that were infected by 93JE3 and P72 were
populated with more spores than in poplars infected by 09AX27\*

**Uredinia size**. The spore size in the poplars infected by P72 had the
smallest size (score = 3).

**Bottom line**. The key takeaway from this analysis is poplars could
resist the population of the spores from pathogen 09AX27. When the
poplar leaves were populated by spores, poplar could still resist the
spore population from pathogen 09AX27, but not from 93JE3 and P72.
Approaching day 14 (incubation period = 14 days), poplars could not
resist the growth of pathogen 09AX27 anymore, but could resist the
growth of pathogen 93JE3, and especially pathogen P72.
